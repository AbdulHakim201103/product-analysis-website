The cake is very small for the price. But omg its delicious we have sampled so far this banana rum cake sooo god and the chocolate rum cake omg it was right on time for my pms chocolate indulgence so tasty."

This was my family’s Christmas dessert and everyone loved it! My son in law loved it so much that I recently ordered him a personal one for himself."
